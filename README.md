## How to use

### Organization
The tutorials are presented in sequence, starting from the simplest concepts and gradually moving to more complex and broader topics.  
Each concept is introduced step by step, followed by clear examples that can be reproduced directly.  
Students are encouraged to modify the provided code and apply it to other small projects, reinforcing understanding and solidifying knowledge through experimentation.

### Compatibility
All code examples have been developed and tested using **Arduino IDE version 2.3.5**.  
The reference hardware used throughout this repository is the **ESP32-WROOM-1** development board.  
While most sketches should work on other ESP32 variants, minor adjustments may be required (e.g., pin mappings).
