# Chapter 1 — Basics

## Goals

- Explain the problem (objective & use cases)
- Draw the algorithm (flowchart)
- Write C code matching the algorithm
- Test with clear cases

=== "Flowchart (pseudo)"
    ```text
    Start → Read Sensor → Threshold? → Actuate → Loop
    ```
=== "C Snippet"
    ```c
    bool above_threshold(int v, int th){ return v > th; }
    ```
